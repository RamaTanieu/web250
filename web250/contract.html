		<h2>Course Contract</h2>
	
		<p>
			I, <a href="introduction.html">Rama E Tanieu</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2024 WEB250 Database Driven Websites Course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. 
			I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
			As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
		</p>
		

		<p>
			Signed: <em>Rama E Tanieu, 22 February 2024</em>
